# SSPOR_pub

This repository contains Matlab code to reproduce results for the sparse sensor placement optimization for reconstruction (SSPOR) algorithm.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, two of the analyzed datasets are linked online:

- Cylinder flow is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/191ut5utn5d0jk5/ALL.mat?dl=0).

- Ocean sea surface temperature data is provided by [NOAA](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html).

To run the compressed sensing (CS) code, please download the [CVX convex optimization package](http://cvxr.com/cvx/).
