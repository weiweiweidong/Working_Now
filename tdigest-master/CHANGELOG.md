## Changelog

### 0.5.2.1
 - Fixes pickling error when using PySpark.

### 0.5.2
 - added new methods onto `TDigest` object: 
   - `to_dict()`: return a Python dictionary of the TDigest and internal   Centroid values.
   - `update_from_dict(dict_values)`: update from serialized dictionary values   into the TDigest object.
   - `centroids_to_list()`: return a Python list of the TDigest object's   internal Centroid values.
   - `update_centroids_from_list(list_values)`: update Centroids from a python list.

### 0.5.0
 - updated to use new accumulation_tree library. This replacement means much better performance in updating the TDigest. 
 - TDigest is Python3 only going forward. 
 - Fixed issues with `percentile` function
 - `quantile` has be renamed to the more correct name `cdf`

### 0.4.1.0
 - fixed a bug in `trimmed_mean` that was giving incorrect results. Proper interpolation and tests correct this. 

### 0.4.0.2
 - new dependency updates.
 - fix quantile with only one centroid.

### 0.3.0
 - The definition of percentile was used incorrectly in tdigest. Previous to 0.3.0, 
  a percentile was defined between 0 and 1. In fact, a percentile is defined between 0 and 100 (hence the 'percent' in percentile). This follows other conventions, like in Numpy and Scipy. This affects the `TDigest.percentile` function. 

### 0.2.0
 - Make the *tdigest* library Python3 compatible. 

### 0.1.2

 - the `TDigest` was not handling ints very well. For example, given `[1,2,2,2,2,2,3]`, it would return that the percentile was `3`. With the fix, it is possible that a centroid can exceed its size threshold.
 - `batch_update` function now has a kwarg to specify the weight of all elements in the inputted array.
